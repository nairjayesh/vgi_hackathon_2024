# VGI Challenge
> How does the VGI-FLEXI move in rural areas ?

### Description
Since June 2022, on-demand buses have been operating in selected areas of the VGI region around Ingolstadt to efficiently serve the irregular demand in rural regions. The precise data collection of these on-demand buses' travel behavior offers significant opportunities to gain valuable insights and better tailor services to the needs of the rural population of Ingolstadt.

### Objective
Visualization of the spatio-temporal travel behavior of VGI-Flexi users.

### Requirements
Anonymized demand data for an on-demand area will be provided for one month. Using software of your choice (e.g., Python, R), you can first statically identify the most demanded bus stops (e.g., heatmaps) and then dynamically integrate the temporal component (e.g., ShinyApp). Ideally, the Flexi bus will drive on the demanded routes.

### How To Run
- ```streamlit run app.py```
